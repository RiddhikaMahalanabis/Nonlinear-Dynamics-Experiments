# Nonlinear-Dynamics-Experiments

A collection of standard nonlinear dynamical systems implemented in Python.

This project aims to:
- Revisit classical nonlinear systems (Duffing, van der Pol, Lorenz, etc.)
- Explore their dynamics numerically and visually

## Systems included
- Duffing oscillator
- van der Pol oscillator (TBD)
- Rossler attractor (TBD)
- Lorenz attractor (TBD)
